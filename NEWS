Version 0.3.0 - June 2011

  * Make CMake work with MSVC.  This generator is special,
    it generates both Debug and Release configurations.
    [QbProg]

  * Add an option to enable maximum warning levels
    [QbProg]

  * Improve handling of CMake options
    [Hugh Sorby]

  * Fix build failures with g++ 4.6
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Clean up CMakeLists.txt, remove unused macros.
    [Mark Pictor]

  * Create two config files, one is used during compilation,
    another one is used when linking against OCE.  The latter
    contains fewer macros, and they are prefixed by OCE_ to
    prevent name clashes.
    [Mark Pictor]

  * Start fixing compiler warnings.
    [QbProg, Thomas Paviot]

  * Create a bundle for MSVC
    [QbProg]

  * Fix cross compilation with Mingw.  We were not able to
    build visualization stuff previously.
    [Muellni]

  * Install an OCEConfig.cmake file so that programs can use
    FIND_PACKAGE(OCE) to set variables to link against OCE.
    [Muellni]

  * Undefine Convex before it is used by OCE as a method or
    function, this may be a macro defined by X11.h
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Remove -DLIN from compiler flags.  It still works on Linux,
    and this causes crashes on Mac OSX.
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Delete inc/TopOpeBRep_tools.hxx, this file is unused, and it
    includes TopOpeBRepDS_tools.hxx which does not exist.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Remove Autotools files for Unix and MSVC, CMake build system
    works fine on these platforms.  We keep Borland project
    files for now, this IDE is not supported by CMake.
    [Thomas Paviot]

Version 0.2.0 - May 2011

  * Add CMake build files, based on the opencascade-cmake project
      http://code.google.com/p/opencascade-cmake/
    Works fine on Linux, needs more testing on Mac OSX and Windows.
    [Hugh Sorby, Thomas Paviot, Mark Pictor, Denis Barbier, QbProg]

  * Let CMake generate env.sh and env.csh scripts with
    accurate variables.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Fix lines in Visual3d_Layer class.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Changes required to build OCE on some non-x86 architectures
    on Unix.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Add OpenMP support, users can choose between OpenMP and TBB.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * When building with CMake, paths are set at compile time so that
    everything works without having to set environment variables.
    [Denis Barbier]

Version 0.1.0 - April 2011

  * Import OCC 6.5.0
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Add instructions for cloning/pulling with git and for
    building from sources.
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Replace Abs(foo < bar) by Abs(foo) < bar.
    These bugs have been reported on the opencascade forum:
      http://www.opencascade.org/org/forum/thread_20187/
      BugID=OCC22324
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Rename guards for MSVC specific pragmas from WNT to _MSC_VER.
    These are mainly #pragma warnings or MSVCRT specific things.
    [QbProg]

  * Fix build failures with Borland compiler.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Add project files for Borland Developer Studio 10.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Fix build failures with Mingw.
    [Jérôme Robert]

  * Add new Automake conditionals: HAVE_X11 and IS_WINDOWS.
    When X11 is not found, do not compile sources from Xw and
    ImageUtility. On Windows, compile files from ros/src/WNT.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Improve Autools usage.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Assume /usr when --with-gl2ps/--with-freeimage configure
    options are specified without arguments.
