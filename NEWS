Version 0.6.0 - September 2011

 *   Cmake 2.8 is explicitly required to build OCE.

 *   Removed many X11 dependencies. Now it is possible to build a large part of
     OCE (with the exception of visualisation) without depending on X11 (using
     OCE_DISABLE_X11 option).

 *   Cmake support : Cmake users will be able to correctly find OCE using
     FIND_PACKAGE(OCE). Several examples are added to show how to use it in
     end-user programs. It is now possible to detect/request single toolkits.

 *   Packaging : change installation paths; we do no more install files at the
     same location as OpenCascade, but adopted more standard paths.

 *   Tests : integrated gtest 1.6.0 and added other unit tests, which helped in
     fixing some bugs. Added MSVC support to the testsuite.

 *   Win32/MSVC improvements:
     + Enabled configuration files in Win32 platforms
     + Plugins and TKOpenGL are correctly found in debug builds
     + TKOpenGL works when building static libraries

 *   Modify tcl scripts to not require $env(CASROOT).

 *   Many small changes, bug fixes and warning removals.
     + Improvements to OSD_Process::SystemDate()
     + TKernel : add dependency against -ldl.
     + Bugfix : Work around a cmake bug that prevented building Win64+MSVC+static libs
     + Bugfix : add missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx.
     + Bugfix : fix mismatch new/delete in Standard_Failure.cxx
     + Fixed compiler warnings in OpenGl_TextureBox.cxx
     + Whitespace cleanup
     + In module TKOpenGL, fixed the two remaining GCC warnings of the form :
       "comparison between ‘enum texStatus’ and ‘enum texDataStatus’"
     + Added missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx
     + Fix capitalization of include file
     + pass NULL for timezone pointer to gettimeofday()
     + eliminate bad cast by copying to local variable
     + use localtime_r if available
     + Do not redefine memmove as an alias for memcpy
     + Workaround GCC (< 4.3) bugs in gp_Mat, gp_XYZ, gp_Mat2d and gp_XY.
     + Fix HashCode, it could segault when MMGT_OPT is not set to 1.

Version 0.5.0 - August 2011

This released integrated OCCT 6.5.1, continued on the warning cleanup, and
fixed some bugs. This a ABI breaking release, due to the warning fixes
and the new OCCT version.
Programs compiled with OCCT 6.5.1 will compile untouched with OCE 0.5.0

 *   OCCT 6.5.1 : aligned to the lasted OpenCascade Tecnology release,
     while mantaining all the patches previously applyed.

 *   Breaking changes : to allow the removal of many compiler warnings, we
     did some breaking changes in some of the headers, mainly related to the
     type of private class fields. Existing code will still compile untouched.

 *   Warning removal and code cleanup : we removed many other warnings and
     cleaned up some functions. Some cppcheck warnings were also fixed.

 *   Added TBB support in memory allocation : OCE builds compiled with the
     TBB option on will benefit from it's multithreaded memory allocator.

 *   Bug fixes : some bugs were spotted during the cleanup process, and
     were fixed and reported. Other bugs were noticed from the forum and
     fixed.

 *   Installing version information : Programs using CMake will allow to find
     OCE with a specific version string.

 *   Program using OCE won't require to compile with -DHAVE_OCE_CONFIG anymore.

Version 0.4.0 - July 2011

This release focused on improving code quality and the cmake build system.

 *   CPack support : including DEB,RPM and MacOsX package generation

 *   CTest support : initial infrastructure to develop unit tests using
     googletest and CTest. Actually working in Linux and MacOsX.

 *   CDash support : http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=OCE to see the
     status of the tests on various platforms

 *   Fixed many compiler warnings: this allows to have a cleaner compilation
     and helped in finding some bugs. Probably many of the annoying MSVC CRT
     debug error windows are also gone.
     Some warnings may still be present, and will be fixed in successive versions.

 *   Added NMake support
 *   Drastically reduced MSVC compilation time, using precompiled headers

 *   Added version information in Win32 DLLs: this information will be useful
     for installers and packaging systems.

 *   Let OCEConfig.cmake use relative paths in order to allow moving
     install tree (related to Linux and MacOsX)

Version 0.3.0 - June 2011

  * Make CMake work with MSVC.  This generator is special,
    it generates both Debug and Release configurations.
    [QbProg]

  * Add an option to enable maximum warning levels
    [QbProg]

  * Improve handling of CMake options
    [Hugh Sorby]

  * Fix build failures with g++ 4.6
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Clean up CMakeLists.txt, remove unused macros.
    [Mark Pictor]

  * Create two config files, one is used during compilation,
    another one is used when linking against OCE.  The latter
    contains fewer macros, and they are prefixed by OCE_ to
    prevent name clashes.
    [Mark Pictor]

  * Start fixing compiler warnings.
    [QbProg, Thomas Paviot]

  * Create a bundle for MSVC
    [QbProg]

  * Fix cross compilation with Mingw.  We were not able to
    build visualization stuff previously.
    [Muellni]

  * Install an OCEConfig.cmake file so that programs can use
    FIND_PACKAGE(OCE) to set variables to link against OCE.
    [Muellni]

  * Undefine Convex before it is used by OCE as a method or
    function, this may be a macro defined by X11.h
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Remove -DLIN from compiler flags.  It still works on Linux,
    and this causes crashes on Mac OSX.
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Delete inc/TopOpeBRep_tools.hxx, this file is unused, and it
    includes TopOpeBRepDS_tools.hxx which does not exist.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Remove Autotools files for Unix and MSVC, CMake build system
    works fine on these platforms.  We keep Borland project
    files for now, this IDE is not supported by CMake.
    [Thomas Paviot]

Version 0.2.0 - May 2011

  * Add CMake build files, based on the opencascade-cmake project
      http://code.google.com/p/opencascade-cmake/
    Works fine on Linux, needs more testing on Mac OSX and Windows.
    [Hugh Sorby, Thomas Paviot, Mark Pictor, Denis Barbier, QbProg]

  * Let CMake generate env.sh and env.csh scripts with
    accurate variables.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Fix lines in Visual3d_Layer class.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Changes required to build OCE on some non-x86 architectures
    on Unix.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Add OpenMP support, users can choose between OpenMP and TBB.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * When building with CMake, paths are set at compile time so that
    everything works without having to set environment variables.
    [Denis Barbier]

Version 0.1.0 - April 2011

  * Import OCC 6.5.0
    [Thomas Paviot]

  * Add instructions for cloning/pulling with git and for
    building from sources.

    These bugs have been reported on the opencascade forum:
      http://www.opencascade.org/org/forum/thread_20187/
      BugID=OCC22324
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Rename guards for MSVC specific pragmas from WNT to _MSC_VER.
    These are mainly #pragma warnings or MSVCRT specific things.
    [QbProg]

  * Fix build failures with Borland compiler.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Add project files for Borland Developer Studio 10.
    [Fotis Sioutis]

  * Fix build failures with Mingw.
    [Jérôme Robert]

  * Add new Automake conditionals: HAVE_X11 and IS_WINDOWS.
    When X11 is not found, do not compile sources from Xw and
    ImageUtility. On Windows, compile files from ros/src/WNT.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Improve Autools usage.
    [Denis Barbier]

  * Assume /usr when --with-gl2ps/--with-freeimage configure
    options are specified without arguments.
