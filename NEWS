    MMGT_MMAP_DEFAULT  
    MMGT_CELLSIZE_DEFAULT  
    MMGT_NBPAGES_DEFAULT  
    MMGT_THRESHOLD_DEFAULT  
    MMGT_REENTRANT_DEFAULT  

* Allow building unversioned libraries : 
  Third-party applications which embed OCE may find convenient
  to drop version numbers from libraries.  
  With this commit, one can call cmake -DOCE_NO_LIBRARY_VERSION=ON.  
  This is based on a similar feature found in VTK.

* Disabled the BSpline mesher, since it generates over-refined meshes. 
  The generic one will be used instead.

* Removed src/FontMFT/*.mft files

* More tests added : Step import and mesher

* Win32 specific changes :
  - Install Debug and Release libraries into the same directory
  - Automatically define WNT depending on compiler predefined macros
  - Auto-install TBB dlls
  - Export the target informations in Win32. This allows to find OCE from 
    cmake projects even win 32.

     OCE (with the exception of visualisation) without depending on X11 (using
     OCE_DISABLE_X11 option).

 *   Cmake support : Cmake users will be able to correctly find OCE using
     FIND_PACKAGE(OCE). Several examples are added to show how to use it in
     end-user programs. It is now possible to detect/request single toolkits.

 *   Packaging : change installation paths; we do no more install files at the
     same location as OpenCascade, but adopted more standard paths.

 *   Tests : integrated gtest 1.6.0 and added other unit tests, which helped in
     fixing some bugs. Added MSVC support to the testsuite.

 *   Win32/MSVC improvements:
     + Enabled configuration files in Win32 platforms
     + Plugins and TKOpenGL are correctly found in debug builds
     + TKOpenGL works when building static libraries

 *   Modify tcl scripts to not require $env(CASROOT).

 *   Many small changes, bug fixes and warning removals.
     + Improvements to OSD_Process::SystemDate()
     + TKernel : add dependency against -ldl.
     + Bugfix : Work around a cmake bug that prevented building Win64+MSVC+static libs
     + Bugfix : add missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx.
     + Bugfix : fix mismatch new/delete in Standard_Failure.cxx
     + Fixed compiler warnings in OpenGl_TextureBox.cxx
     + Whitespace cleanup
     + In module TKOpenGL, fixed the two remaining GCC warnings of the form :
       "comparison between ‘enum texStatus’ and ‘enum texDataStatus’"
     + Added missing include in BRepBlend_BlendTool.lxx
     + Fix capitalization of include file
     + pass NULL for timezone pointer to gettimeofday()
     + eliminate bad cast by copying to local variable
     + use localtime_r if available
     + Do not redefine memmove as an alias for memcpy
     + Workaround GCC (< 4.3) bugs in gp_Mat, gp_XYZ, gp_Mat2d and gp_XY.
     + Fix HashCode, it could segault when MMGT_OPT is not set to 1.

Version 0.5.0 - August 2011

This released integrated OCCT 6.5.1, continued on the warning cleanup, and
fixed some bugs. This a ABI breaking release, due to the warning fixes
and the new OCCT version.
Programs compiled with OCCT 6.5.1 will compile untouched with OCE 0.5.0

 *   OCCT 6.5.1 : aligned to the lasted OpenCascade Tecnology release,
     while mantaining all the patches previously applyed.

 *   Breaking changes : to allow the removal of many compiler warnings, we
     did some breaking changes in some of the headers, mainly related to the
     type of private class fields. Existing code will still compile untouched.

 *   Warning removal and code cleanup : we removed many other warnings and
     cleaned up some functions. Some cppcheck warnings were also fixed.

 *   Added TBB support in memory allocation : OCE builds compiled with the
     TBB option on will benefit from it's multithreaded memory allocator.

 *   Bug fixes : some bugs were spotted during the cleanup process, and
     were fixed and reported. Other bugs were noticed from the forum and
     fixed.

 *   Installing version information : Programs using CMake will allow to find
     OCE with a specific version string.

 *   Program using OCE won't require to compile with -DHAVE_OCE_CONFIG anymore.

Version 0.4.0 - July 2011

This release focused on improving code quality and the cmake build system.

 *   CPack support : including DEB,RPM and MacOsX package generation

 *   CTest support : initial infrastructure to develop unit tests using
     googletest and CTest. Actually working in Linux and MacOsX.

 *   CDash support : http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=OCE to see the
     status of the tests on various platforms

 *   Fixed many compiler warnings: this allows to have a cleaner compilation
     and helped in finding some bugs. Probably many of the annoying MSVC CRT
     debug error windows are also gone.
     Some warnings may still be present, and will be fixed in successive versions.

 *   Added NMake support
 *   Drastically reduced MSVC compilation time, using precompiled headers

 *   Added version information in Win32 DLLs: this information will be useful
     for installers and packaging systems.

 *   Let OCEConfig.cmake use relative paths in order to allow moving
     install tree (related to Linux and MacOsX)

    contains fewer macros, and they are prefixed by OCE_ to
    prevent name clashes.
    [Mark Pictor]

  * Start fixing compiler warnings.
    [QbProg, Thomas Paviot]
