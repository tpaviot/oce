//!  Some fields of an IGES entity may be <br>
//! - Undefined <br>
//! - Defined as a positive integer <br>
//! - Defined as a reference to a specialized entity. <br>
//!  A typical example of this kind of variation is color. <br>
//! This enumeration allows you to identify which of the above is the case. <br>
//! The semantics of the terms are as follows: <br>
//! - DefVoid indicates that the item contained in the field is undefined <br>
//! - DefValue indicates that the item is defined as an immediate <br>
//!   positive integer value (i.e. not a pointer) <br>
//! - DefReference indicates that the item is defined as an entity <br>
//! - DefAny indicates the item could not be determined <br>
//! - ErrorVal indicates that the item is defined as an integer <br>
//!   but its value is incorrect (it could be out of range, for example) <br>
//! - ErrorRef indicates that the item is defined as an entity but <br>
//!    is not of the required type. <br>
