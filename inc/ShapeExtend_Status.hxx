#ifndef _ShapeExtend_Status_HeaderFile
#define _ShapeExtend_Status_HeaderFile

//! This enumeration is used in <br>
//! ShapeHealing toolkit for representing flags in the <br>
//! return statuses of class methods. <br>
//! The status is a field of the class which is set by one or <br>
//! several methods of that class. <br>
//! It is used for reporting about errors and other situations <br>
//! encountered during execution of the method. <br>
//! There are defined 8 values for DONE and 8 for FAIL flags: <br>
//!      ShapeExtend_DONE1 ...      ShapeExtend_DONE8, <br>
//!      ShapeExtend_FAIL1 ...      ShapeExtend_FAIL8 <br>
//! and also enumerations for representing combinations of flags: <br>
//!      ShapeExtend_OK - no flags at all, <br>
//!      ShapeExtend_DONE - any of flags DONEi, <br>
//!      ShapeExtend_FAIL - any of flags FAILi. <br>
//! The class that uses statuses provides a method(s) which <br>
//! answers whether the flag corresponding to a given <br>
//! enumerative value is (are) set: <br>
//! Standard_Boolean Status(const ShapeExtend_Status test); <br>
//! Note that status can have several flags set simultaneously. <br>
//! Status(ShapeExtend_OK) gives True when no flags are set. <br>
//!  Nothing done, everything OK <br>
//!  Something was done, case 1 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 2 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 3 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 4 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 5 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 6 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 7 <br>
//!  Something was done, case 8 <br>
//!  Something was done (any of DONE#) <br>
//!  The method failed, case 1 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 2 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 3 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 4 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 5 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 6 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 7 <br>
//!  The method failed, case 8 <br>
//!  The mathod failed (any of FAIL# occured) <br>
