//! This class is intended to output free bounds of the shape <br>
//!          (free bounds are the wires consisting of edges referenced by the <br>
//!          only face). <br>
//!          For building free bounds it uses ShapeAnalysis_FreeBounds class. <br>
//!          This class complements it with the feature to reduce the number <br>
//!          of open wires. <br>
//!          This reduction is performed with help of connecting several <br>
//!          adjacent open wires one to another what can lead to: <br>
//!          1. making an open wire with greater length out of several <br>
//!             open wires <br>
//!          2. making closed wire out of several open wires <br>
