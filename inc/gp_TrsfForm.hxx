//! Identifies the type of a geometric transformation. <br>//! Enumerates all 24 possible variants of generalized <br>
//!          Euler angles, defining general 3d rotation by three <br>
//!          rotations around main axes of coordinate system, <br>
//!          in different possible orders. <br>
//!          The name of the enumeration <br>
//! 	      corresponds to order of rotations, prefixed by type <br>
//!          of co-ordinate system used: <br>
//!          - Intrinsic: rotations are made around axes of rotating <br>
//!            co-ordinate system associated with the object <br>
//!          - Extrinsic: rotations are made around axes of fixed <br>
//!            (reference) co-ordinate system <br>
//!          Two specific values provided for most frequently used <br>
//!          conventions: proper Euler angles (intrinsic ZXZ) and <br>
//!          yaw-pitch-roll (intrinsic ZYX). <br>
