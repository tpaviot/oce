//! Lets you choose the manner in which you want to analyze an <br>
//! IGES or STEP file. Your analysis can be either message-oriented or <br>
//! entity-oriented. The specific values are as follows: <br>
//! - ItemsByEntity is a sequential list of all <br>
//! messages per entity of the defined type <br>
//! - CountByItem is the number of entities of the defined <br>
//! type, with their rank number per message <br>
//! - ShortByItem is the number of entities of the defined <br>
//! type, with their types per message; displays the rank <br>
//! numbers of the first five entities of the defined type <br>
//! per message <br>
//! - ListByItem is the number of entities of the defined type <br>
//! per message and the numbers of the entities <br>
//! - EntitiesByItem is the number of entities of the <br>
//! defined type, with their types, rank numbers and <br>
//! Directory Entry numbers per message <br>
//! - GeneralInfo is general information on transfer such as: <br>
//!    -      number of entities <br>
//!    -      number of roots <br>
//!    -      number of resulting Open CASCADE shapes <br>
//!    -      number of warnings and failures <br>
//!    -      CountSummary summary statistics for counters and signatures <br>
//!    -      ResultCount information that contains the number of <br>
//!       roots in the IGES file and the number of resulting Open CASCADE shapes. <br>
//!  -       Mapping of the IGES root entities to the resulting Open <br>
//!   CASCADE shape (including type and form of the IGES entity <br>
//! and type of the resulting shape). <br>
