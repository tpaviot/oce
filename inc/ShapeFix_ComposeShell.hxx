//! This class is intended to create a shell from the composite <br>
//!          surface (grid of surfaces) and set of wires. <br>
//!          It may be either division of the supporting surface of the <br>
//!          face, or creating a shape corresponding to face on composite <br>
//!          surface which is missing in CAS.CADE but exists in some other <br>
//!          systems. <br>
//! <br>
//!          It splits (if necessary) original face to several ones by <br>
//!          splitting lines which are joint lines on a supplied grid of <br>
//!          surfaces (U- and V- isolines of the  composite surface). <br>
//!          There are two modes of work, which differ in the way of <br>
//!          handling faces on periodic surfaces: <br>
//! <br>
//!        - if ClosedMode is False (default), when splitting itself is <br>
//!          done as if surface were not periodic. The periodicity of the <br>
//!          underlying surface is taken into account by duplicating splitting <br>
//!          lines in the periodic direction, as necessary to split all <br>
//!          the wires (whole parametrical range of a face) <br>
//!          In this mode, some regularization procedures are performed <br>
//!          (indexation of splitted segments by patch numbers), and it is <br>
//!          expected to be more reliable and robust in case of bad shapes <br>
//! <br>
//!        - if ClosedMode is True, when everything on a periodic surfaces <br>
//!          is considered as modulo period. This allows to deal with wires <br>
//!          which are closed in 3d but not in 2d, with wires which may be <br>
//!          shifted on several periods in 2d etc. However, this mode is <br>
//!          less reliable since some regularizations do not work for it. <br>
//! <br>
//!          The work is made basing on pcurves of the edges. These pcurves <br>
//!          should already exist (for example, in the case of division of <br>
//!          existing face), then they are taken as is. The existing pcurves <br>
//!          should be assigned to one surface (face) for all edges, <br>
//!          this surface (face) will be used only for accessing pcurves, <br>
//!          and it may have any geometry. <br>
//! <br>
//!          All the modifications are recorded in the context tool <br>
//!          (ShapeBuild_ReShape). <br>
