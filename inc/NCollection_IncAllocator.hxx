/**
 *  Class NCollection_IncAllocator - incremental memory  allocator. This class
 *  allocates  memory  on  request  returning  the  pointer  to  an  allocated
 *  block. This memory is never returned  to the system until the allocator is
 *  destroyed.
 *  
 *  By comparison with  the standard new() and malloc()  calls, this method is
 *  faster and consumes very small additional memory to maintain the heap.
 *  
 *  All pointers  returned by Allocate() are  aligned to the size  of the data
 *  type "aligned_t". To  modify the size of memory  blocks requested from the
 *  OS,  use the parameter  of the  constructor (measured  in bytes);  if this
 *  parameter is  smaller than  25 bytes on  32bit or  49 bytes on  64bit, the
 *  block size will be the default 24 kbytes
