//! Lists the types of fillet shapes. These include the following: <br>
//! -   ChFi3d_Rational (default value), which is the <br>
//!   standard NURBS representation of circles, <br>
//! -   ChFi3d_QuasiAngular, which is a NURBS <br>
//!   representation of circles where the parameters <br>
//!   match those of the circle, <br>
//! -   ChFi3d_Polynomial, which corresponds to a <br>
//!   polynomial approximation of circles. This type <br>
//!   facilitates the implementation of the construction algorithm. <br>
