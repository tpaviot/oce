//! To deal with different results in the computation of curvatures. <br>
//! -   FairCurve_OK describes the case where computation is successfully <br>
//!   completed <br>
//! -   FairCurve_NotConverged describes <br>
//!   the case where the algorithm does not <br>
//!   converge. In this case, you can not be <br>
//!   certain of the result quality and should <br>
//!   resume computation if you want to make use of the curve. <br>
//! -   FairCurve_InfiniteSliding describes the case where sliding is infinite, and, <br>
//!   consequently, computation stops. The solution is to use an imposed sliding value. <br>
//! -   FairCurve_NullHeight describes the case where no matter is left at one of the <br>
//!   ends of the curve, and as a result, computation stops. The solution is to <br>
//!   change (increase or reduce) the slope value by increasing or decreasing it. <br>
