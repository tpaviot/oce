//! This class provides for a framework to construct a shell <br>
//! or a solid along a spine consisting in a wire. <br>
//! To produce a solid, the initial wire must be closed. <br>
//! Two approaches are used: <br>
//! - definition by section <br>
//!   - by a section and a scaling law <br>
//!   - by addition of successive intermediary sections <br>
//! - definition by sweep mode. <br>
//!   - pseudo-Frenet <br>
//!  - constant <br>
//!  - binormal constant <br>
//!  - normal defined by a surface support <br>
//!  - normal defined by a guiding contour. <br>
//!  The two global approaches can also be combined. <br>
//!  You can also close the surface later in order to form a solid. <br>
//!  Warning: In this version some limitation exist <br>
//!   -- We can add only 1 Section (else Standard_NotImplemented is raised <br>
//!   -- Mode with auxilary spine is incompatible with hometetic laws <br>
//!   -- Mode with auxilary spine and keep contact produce only CO surface. <br>
//!   -- Transition treatement is implemented only with the option <BRepBuilderAPI_Transformed> <br>
//!  Normaly all these limitations have to be deleted in mext version. <br>
