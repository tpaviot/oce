puts "plane. Its a planer curve and we want to offset it by the amount which"
puts "is feasible. after trying with all options we were not able to offset it."
puts "But the same wire when we read inside EUCLID3 as well as CATIA it does"

puts "Dear Sergey,"

puts "Below you will find conclusion of JGV about thia bug"
puts "Bugmaster"
puts "   This case can not be done by existing algorithm. It is mathematical"
puts "limitation: the offset may be performed only from at least C1-continuous"
puts "curve, but all the 12 edges of initial wire are based on C0-continuous"
puts "curves."
puts "   I may modify the algorithm so that it splits initial edges into"
puts "C1-continuous curves, but then resulting wire will consist of too many"
puts "small edges (in our case the number of edges will increase about 100"
puts "times)."
puts "  But user may obtain initial wire more smooth: when he intersects"
puts "something with a plane by command \"section\", he can add the key \"-a\""
puts "(force approximation)."
