# Building of triangulation for distored surfaces can take very long using BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh
#
# Test case was created to control bad situation, building of triangulation takes
# very long time and it is expected by the meaning of issue #25378.
# Case when it is passed too fast should be considered as failure.
