//! Some fields of an IGES entity may be <br>
//! - Undefined <br>
//! - Defined as a single item <br>
//! - Defined as a list of items. <br>
//!   A typical example, which presents this kind of variation, <br>
//! is a level number. <br>
//! This enumeration allows you to identify which of the above is the case. <br>
//! The semantics of the terms is as follows: <br>
//! - DefNone indicates that the list is empty (there is not <br>
//!   even a single item). <br>
//! - DefOne indicates that the list contains a single item. <br>
//! - DefSeveral indicates that the list contains several items. <br>
//! - ErrorOne indicates that the list contains one item, but <br>
//!   that this item is incorrect <br>
//! - ErrorSeveral indicates that the list contains several <br>
//!   items, but that at least one of them is incorrect. <br>
