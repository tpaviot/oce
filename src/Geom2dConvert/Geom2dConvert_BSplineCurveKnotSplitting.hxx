//! An algorithm to determine points at which a BSpline <br>
//!  curve should be split in order to obtain arcs of the same continuity. <br>
//! If you require curves with a minimum continuity for <br>
//! your computation, it is useful to know the points <br>
//! between which an arc has a continuity of a given <br>
//! order. For a BSpline curve, the discontinuities are <br>
//! localized at the knot values. Between two knot values <br>
//! the BSpline is infinitely and continuously <br>
//! differentiable. At a given knot, the continuity is equal <br>
//! to: Degree - Mult, where Degree is the <br>
//! degree of the BSpline curve and Mult is the multiplicity of the knot. <br>
//! It is possible to compute the arcs which correspond to <br>
//! this splitting using the global function <br>
//! SplitBSplineCurve provided by the package Geom2dConvert. <br>
//! A BSplineCurveKnotSplitting object provides a framework for: <br>
//! -   defining the curve to be analysed and the required degree of continuity, <br>
//! -   implementing the computation algorithm, and <br>
//! -   consulting the results. <br>

//! are identified by indices in the knots table of BasisCurve. <br>
//! Use the available interrogation functions to access <br>
//! computed values, followed by the global function <br>
//! SplitBSplineCurve (provided by the package <br>
//! Geom2dConvert) to split the curve. <br>

//! Notes: <br>
//! -   If Index is equal to 1, the corresponding knot <br>
