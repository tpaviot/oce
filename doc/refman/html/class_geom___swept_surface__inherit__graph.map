Such a surface is obtained by sweeping a curve (called the &quot;extruded curve&quot; or &quot;basis&quot;) in a given direction (referred to as the &quot;direction of extrusion&quot; and defined by a unit vector). The u parameter is along the extruded curve. The v parameter is along the direction of extrusion. The parameter range for the u parameter is defined by the reference curve. The parameter range for the v parameter is ] &#45; infinity, + infinity [. The position of the curve gives the origin of the v parameter. The surface is &quot;CN&quot; in the v parametric direction. The form of a surface of linear extrusion is generally a ruled surface (GeomAbs_RuledForm). It can be: " alt="" coords="5,304,216,331"/>
