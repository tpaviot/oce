This is the OCE unittest framework.

In order to run tests, you have to compile GoogleTest from the source code
available in the folder oce/test/gtest-1.6.0

You just have to :
$cd src/test/gtest-1.6.0/lib
$cmake ..
$make -j2

And that's all. After that, the CMake builder will find the proper library and headers
locations.
